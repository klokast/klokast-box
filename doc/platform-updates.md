# Platform VM inspection and tests

Run commands as `smith` on the active `<box>-ops` controller. Inspection and
template tests are explicit operations. They do not replace running VMs.
Inspection writes evidence under `/var/lib/klokast/updates/discovery`.
Downloaded inputs and template artifacts use `/var/cache/klokast/updates`.

## Inspection

- `ansible/bin/platform-update scan --json` collects VM facts and authenticated
  upstream package metadata. `status --json` reads the last report.
- `ansible/bin/platform-update verify --json` checks recorded shared-VM
  assignments, packages, boot files, and services. An absent assignment is
  reported; the command does not adopt a VM.
- `ansible/bin/platform-update inspect-target --box BOX --role dmz --json`
  reports workload, data, configuration, and storage classification.
- `ansible/bin/platform-update-config-audit --box BOX --role dmz --json`
  compares configuration with the checked-in recipes.
- Use `platform-map` and `platform-check --box BOX --target router` for router
  observations and health checks. Standalone router release comparisons are retired.

## Isolated application component test

`ansible/bin/platform-update prepare --box BOX --branch v3.24` builds and tests
an isolated shared-VM template. `--inputs-only` stops before the Xen test.
`--test-app static-site-web` tests the declared image with synthetic data.
These commands do not replace a running VM.

Router provisioning qualifies its template in a networkless Xen guest.
Standalone router state-copy, compatibility, candidate-preparation, and cold
test workflows are retired. Their old artifacts remain retained data; removing
the commands does not authorize deletion of their disks, backups, or identities.

## Storage assessment

The discovery report includes retained-data and storage classification.
`ansible/bin/platform-update retention --json` compares declared retention
with discovery. Neither command deletes data or treats unknown storage as empty.

## Provisioning and boot recovery

First router installation runs through `provision-box` phases 30 and 31.
It calls `provision-router phase --box BOX --phase prepare|accept` under the
parent installation lock. Use `provision-router status --box BOX` to read the
protected first-install and boot assignment state. Resume installation through
`provision-box`; individual installation steps are internal.
The checked-in first-install defaults select tested stable Alpine
branches at least 21 days old and require selection evidence no older than 30 hours.
These are checked-in first-install defaults, not Instance update policy.

Dom0 record readers and boot recovery preserve accepted assignments and pending
operations. Keep required records, previous disks, backups, and recovery hooks.
Remove a recovery hook only after its dependent boot assignments have been
reconciled through a separate operation.

The retained native dispatcher, its installed module set, and the boot hooks
still read historical records. Their names and storage paths retain the old
`router-updates` spelling for compatibility. This does not provide a controller
workflow to start new replacements or cold tests. Pruning native recovery and
changing commit-based engine identities are separate work.

Before deploying the provisioning extraction, inspect the active controller's
journal and each target's protected records through controller automation.
Do not deploy while a replacement, cold test, or incomplete first installation
needs the old tooling. Complete it with the previous revision first. Qualify
the extracted installer on a designated disposable target before a real first
installation. Unit tests do not qualify a live install.

`74-platform-update-discovery.yml` prepares private inspection directories.
Controller convergence runs the same setup tasks. Controller installation
checks pending operations and preserves accepted records and boot hooks; see
[controller operations](platform-syscalls.md).
